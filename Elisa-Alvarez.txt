Stretch Questions

        inline elements are only availble between element tags which makes it hard to flex, float ect out of the flow of the web document example main nav.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        It takes that element out of the flow of the rest of the document and you can then move it anywhere on the page. it

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
         margin,border, padding, and display.
 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
           Block level elements: <adress> <article> <aside>  Inline:<a> <img> <data> inline-block:<button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model is similar to a newspaper article, you have all your information laid out on the page in the order that it was written. The paper is your margins the margins can be on any side of the items to seperate them from the edge of the page and other sections. Border is inside the margin to allow for a decrative boxes around an element. Padding is the space withing the border so you can move content up down side to side without effecting the flow of the page.
